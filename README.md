  - I have been using Linux and Unix since 2018 by my own will, but I had my experience with Linux at school in 2014.

  - I currently work on a repository (Sakaki-AC-Linux-Guide), to try to facilitate the transition of gamer users from Windows to Linux, contributing to open source, freedom and transparency.
