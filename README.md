- Open source developer and explorer ðŸŒ±.
  - I have been using Linux and Unix since 2018 by my own will, but I had my experience with Linux at school in 2014.
  - I currently use Arch Linux as my main operating system, but I have extensive knowledge of POSIX/*nix, Hackintosh, and Windows.
  - I currently work on a repository (Sakaki-AC-Linux-Guide), to try to facilitate the transition of gamer users from Windows to Linux, contributing to open source, freedom and transparency.
